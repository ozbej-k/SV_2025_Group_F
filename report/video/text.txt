In our project, we successfully implemented and improved upon the stochastic vision-based model of zebrafish behaviour proposed by Koh-lyon and colleagues. From this work, we draw three main conclusions.

First, we verified the correctness of our model. We compared ten-hour-long simulations with equally long real zebrafish recordings. By analysing the probability of a fish being present at any given location in the tank, we showed that our model closely reproduces real zebrafish behaviour.

Second, we extended the model to support irregular environments, as the original model was limited only to rectangular worlds.

Finally, we made the simulation interactive and significantly more performnt by applying several optimisations, such as replacing expensive calculations with fast and accurate approximations.
