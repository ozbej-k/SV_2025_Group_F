## Project description
The study used as the starting point for this assignment was [Collignon et al. 2016](#collignon2016). The paper presents a model describing the visual sensory system of zebrafish, introduces a stochastic process based on a probability distribution function to model fish movement depending on their surroundings. The model is then compared to experimental data acquired by recording real life zebrafish and their changes in behaviour when introducing points of interest into the environment. Our goal is to implement the model, validate it by comparing it to the real life experimental data, and then possibly extend it by adding interactive control over positions of points of interest and differently shaped environments to see how the fish react.

## Project plan
### [Milestone: First report - 16. 11. 2025](https://github.com/ozbej-k/Skupinsko-Vedenje-25-26-GroupF/milestone/1):
- Explore existing vision based models and models which explore points of interest
- Set a strategy for reproducing the results in the source paper
- Discuss and plan implementation (select tools and collect any needed data)

### [Milestone: Second report - 7. 12. 2025](https://github.com/ozbej-k/Skupinsko-Vedenje-25-26-GroupF/milestone/2):
- Include improvements from feedback on the previous report
- Fully implement previously discussed implementation
- Describe our implementation in detail (methods used, possible extensions and deviations from original)
- Describe how we will test and compare our implementation with the original

### [Milestone: Third report - 11. 1. 2026](https://github.com/ozbej-k/Skupinsko-Vedenje-25-26-GroupF/milestone/3):
- Include improvements from feedback on the previous report
- Show our results when compared to existing research
- Provide some ideas for future work, improvements and applications of our final model
- Prepare presentation about our work
